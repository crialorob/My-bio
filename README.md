# My-bio

Throughout my career, I have gained vast experience working in customer success, data insights and analytics teams building visualisations based on critical insights hidden behind the numbers to help businesses achieve their goals faster by applying data-informed strategies.

I strongly advocate for analysing and keeping track of any business activity's environmental and digital footprint and leveraging this data to implement long-term planning processes to protect the environment, expand economic opportunities and meet social needs altogether.

Data Analytics skills:

· Identify, source, and perform cleansing on data from various relevant sources to support required analysis processes.

· Query and analyse databases using SQL to support data management and analysis.

· Conduct exploratory, descriptive, and prescriptive analytics (using Excel, SQL, Python, R).

· Build Tableau and Power BI visualisations to present data and analysis and communicate insights to support business decision-making, including identifying areas for further analysis and exploration.

· Identify appropriate opportunities for business value through data analytics processes.
