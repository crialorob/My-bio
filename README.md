# My-bio

Throughout my career, I have gained vast experience working in customer success, data insights and analytics teams building visualisations based on critical insights hidden behind the numbers to help businesses achieve their goals faster by applying data-informed strategies.

I strongly advocate for analysing and keeping track of any business activity's environmental and digital footprint and leveraging this data to implement long-term planning processes to protect the environment, expand economic opportunities and meet social needs altogether.
